/**
 * Register a module or theme's theme implementations.
 *
 * The implementations declared by this hook have several purposes:
 * - They can specify how a particular render array is to be rendered as HTML.
 *   This is usually the case if the theme function is assigned to the render
 *   array's #theme property.
 * - They can return HTML for default calls to _theme().
 * - They can return HTML for calls to _theme() for a theme suggestion.
 *
 * @param array $existing
 *   An array of existing implementations that may be used for override
 *   purposes. This is primarily useful for themes that may wish to examine
 *   existing implementations to extract data (such as arguments) so that
 *   it may properly register its own, higher priority implementations.
 * @param $type
 *   Whether a theme, module, etc. is being processed. This is primarily useful
 *   so that themes tell if they are the actual theme being called or a parent
 *   theme. May be one of:
 *   - 'module': A module is being checked for theme implementations.
 *   - 'base_theme_engine': A theme engine is being checked for a theme that is
 *     a parent of the actual theme being used.
 *   - 'theme_engine': A theme engine is being checked for the actual theme
 *     being used.
 *   - 'base_theme': A base theme is being checked for theme implementations.
 *   - 'theme': The actual theme in use is being checked.
 * @param $theme
 *   The actual name of theme, module, etc. that is being being processed.
 * @param $path
 *   The directory path of the theme or module, so that it doesn't need to be
 *   looked up.
 *
 * @return array
 *   An associative array of information about theme implementations. The keys
 *   on the outer array are known as "theme hooks". For simple theme
 *   implementations for regular calls to _theme(), the theme hook is the first
 *   argument. For theme suggestions, instead of the array key being the base
 *   theme hook, the key is a theme suggestion name with the format
 *   'base_hook_name__sub_hook_name'. For render elements, the key is the
 *   machine name of the render element. The array values are themselves arrays
 *   containing information about the theme hook and its implementation. Each
 *   information array must contain either a 'variables' element (for _theme()
 *   calls) or a 'render element' element (for render elements), but not both.
 *   The following elements may be part of each information array:
 *   - variables: Used for _theme() call items only: an array of variables,
 *     where the array keys are the names of the variables, and the array
 *     values are the default values if they are not passed into _theme().
 *     Template implementations receive each array key as a variable in the
 *     template file (so they must be legal PHP/Twig variable names). Function
 *     implementations are passed the variables in a single $variables function
 *     argument.
 *   - render element: Used for render element items only: the name of the
 *     renderable element or element tree to pass to the theme function. This
 *     name is used as the name of the variable that holds the renderable
 *     element or tree in preprocess and process functions.
 *   - file: The file the implementation resides in. This file will be included
 *     prior to the theme being rendered, to make sure that the function or
 *     preprocess function (as needed) is actually loaded; this makes it
 *     possible to split theme functions out into separate files quite easily.
 *   - path: Override the path of the file to be used. Ordinarily the module or
 *     theme path will be used, but if the file will not be in the default
 *     path, include it here. This path should be relative to the Drupal root
 *     directory.
 *   - template: If specified, this theme implementation is a template, and
 *     this is the template file without an extension. Do not put .html.twig on
 *     this file; that extension will be added automatically by the default
 *     rendering engine (which is Twig). If 'path' above is specified, the
 *     template should also be in this path.
 *   - function: If specified, this will be the function name to invoke for
 *     this implementation. If neither 'template' nor 'function' is specified,
 *     a default function name will be assumed. For example, if a module
 *     registers the 'node' theme hook, 'theme_node' will be assigned to its
 *     function. If the chameleon theme registers the node hook, it will be
 *     assigned 'chameleon_node' as its function.
 *   - base hook: Used for _theme() suggestions only: the base theme hook name.
 *     Instead of this suggestion's implementation being used directly, the base
 *     hook will be invoked with this implementation as its first suggestion.
 *     The base hook's files will be included and the base hook's preprocess
 *     functions will be called in place of any suggestion's preprocess
 *     functions. If an implementation of hook_theme_suggestions_HOOK() (where
 *     HOOK is the base hook) changes the suggestion order, a different
 *     suggestion may be used in place of this suggestion. If after
 *     hook_theme_suggestions_HOOK() this suggestion remains the first
 *     suggestion, then this suggestion's function or template will be used to
 *     generate the output for _theme().
 *   - pattern: A regular expression pattern to be used to allow this theme
 *     implementation to have a dynamic name. The convention is to use __ to
 *     differentiate the dynamic portion of the theme. For example, to allow
 *     forums to be themed individually, the pattern might be: 'forum__'. Then,
 *     when the forum is themed, call:
 *     @code
 *     _theme(array('forum__' . $tid, 'forum'), $forum)
 *     @endcode
 *   - preprocess functions: A list of functions used to preprocess this data.
 *     Ordinarily this won't be used; it's automatically filled in. By default,
 *     for a module this will be filled in as template_preprocess_HOOK. For
 *     a theme this will be filled in as twig_preprocess and
 *     twig_preprocess_HOOK as well as themename_preprocess and
 *     themename_preprocess_HOOK.
 *   - override preprocess functions: Set to TRUE when a theme does NOT want
 *     the standard preprocess functions to run. This can be used to give a
 *     theme FULL control over how variables are set. For example, if a theme
 *     wants total control over how certain variables in the page.html.twig are
 *     set, this can be set to true. Please keep in mind that when this is used
 *     by a theme, that theme becomes responsible for making sure necessary
 *     variables are set.
 *   - type: (automatically derived) Where the theme hook is defined:
 *     'module', 'theme_engine', or 'theme'.
 *   - theme path: (automatically derived) The directory path of the theme or
 *     module, so that it doesn't need to be looked up.

 * - Status reporting ($phase == 'runtime').
 *
 * Note that this hook, like all others dealing with installation and updates,
 * must reside in a module_name.install file, or it will not properly abort
 * the installation of the module if a critical requirement is missing.
 *
 * During the 'install' phase, modules can for example assert that
 * library or server versions are available or sufficient.
 * Note that the installation of a module can happen during installation of
 * Drupal itself (by install.php) with an installation profile or later by hand.
 * As a consequence, install-time requirements must be checked without access
 * to the full Drupal API, because it is not available during install.php.
 * If a requirement has a severity of REQUIREMENT_ERROR, install.php will abort
 * or at least the module will not install.
 * Other severity levels have no effect on the installation.
 * Module dependencies do not belong to these installation requirements,
 * but should be defined in the module's .info.yml file.
 *
 * The 'runtime' phase is not limited to pure installation requirements
 * but can also be used for more general status information like maintenance
 * tasks and security issues.
 * The returned 'requirements' will be listed on the status report in the
 * administration section, with indication of the severity level.
 * Moreover, any requirement with a severity of REQUIREMENT_ERROR severity will
 * result in a notice on the administration configuration page.
 *
 * @param $phase
 *   The phase in which requirements are checked:
 *   - install: The module is being installed.
 *   - update: The module is enabled and update.php is run.
 *   - runtime: The runtime requirements are being checked and shown on the
 *     status report page.
 *
 * @return
 *   An associative array where the keys are arbitrary but must be unique (it
 *   is suggested to use the module short name as a prefix) and the values are
 *   themselves associative arrays with the following elements:
 *   - title: The name of the requirement.
 *   - value: The current value (e.g., version, time, level, etc). During
 *     install phase, this should only be used for version numbers, do not set
 *     it if not applicable.
 *   - description: The description of the requirement/status.
 *   - severity: The requirement's result/severity level, one of:
 *     - REQUIREMENT_INFO: For info only.
 *     - REQUIREMENT_OK: The requirement is satisfied.

 * newlines and used as the description for the update on the pending updates
 * task list. Schema updates should adhere to the
 * @link http://drupal.org/node/150215 Schema API. @endlink
 *
 * Implementations of hook_update_N() are named (module name)_update_(number).
 * The numbers are composed of three parts:
 * - 1 digit for Drupal core compatibility.
 * - 1 digit for your module's major release version (e.g., is this the 8.x-1.*
 *   (1) or 8.x-2.* (2) series of your module).
 * - 2 digits for sequential counting, starting with 01.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - mymodule_update_8100(): This is the first update to get the database ready
 *   to run mymodule 8.x-1.*.
 * - mymodule_update_8200(): This is the first update to get the database ready
 *   to run mymodule 8.x-2.*.
 *
 * As of Drupal 8.0, the database upgrade system no longer supports updating a
 * database from an earlier major version of Drupal: update.php can be used to
 * upgrade from 7.x-1.x to 7.x-2.x, or 8.x-1.x to 8.x-2.x, but not from 7.x to
 * 8.x. Therefore, only update hooks numbered 8001 or later will run for
 * Drupal 8. 8000 is reserved for the minimum core schema version and defining
 * mymodule_update_8000() will result in an exception. Use the
 * @link https://drupal.org/node/2127611 Migration API @endlink instead to
 * migrate data from an earlier major version of Drupal.
 *
 * For further information about releases and release numbers see:
 * @link http://drupal.org/node/711070 Maintaining a drupal.org project with Git @endlink
 *
 * Never renumber update functions.
 *
 * Implementations of this hook should be placed in a mymodule.install file in
 * the same directory as mymodule.module. Drupal core's updates are implemented
 * using the system module as a name and stored in database/updates.inc.
 *
 * Not all module functions are available from within a hook_update_N() function.
 * In order to call a function from your mymodule.module or an include file,
 * you need to explicitly load that file first.
 *
 * During database updates the schema of any module could be out of date. For
 * this reason, caution is needed when using any API function within an update
 * function - particularly CRUD functions, functions that depend on the schema
 * (for example by using drupal_write_record()), and any functions that invoke
 * hooks.
 *
 * The $sandbox parameter should be used when a multipass update is needed, in
 * circumstances where running the whole update at once could cause PHP to
 * timeout. Each pass is run in a way that avoids PHP timeouts, provided each
 * pass remains under the timeout limit. To signify that an update requires
 * at least one more pass, set $sandbox['#finished'] to a number less than 1
 * (you need to do this each pass). The value of $sandbox['#finished'] will be
 * unset between passes but all other data in $sandbox will be preserved. The
 * system will stop iterating this update when $sandbox['#finished'] is left
 * unset or set to a number higher than 1. It is recommended that
 * $sandbox['#finished'] is initially set to 0, and then updated each pass to a
 * number between 0 and 1 that represents the overall % completed for this
 * update, finishing with 1.
 *
 * See the @link batch Batch operations topic @endlink for more information on
 * how to use the Batch API.
 *
 * @param array $sandbox
 *   Stores information for multipass updates. See above for more information.
 *
 * @throws \Drupal\Core\Utility\UpdateException|PDOException
 *   In case of error, update hooks should throw an instance of
 *   Drupal\Core\Utility\UpdateException with a meaningful message for the user.
 *   If a database query fails for whatever reason, it will throw a
 *   PDOException.
 *
 * @return string|null
 *   Optionally, update hooks may return a translated string that will be
 *   displayed to the user after the update has completed. If no message is
 *   returned, no message will be presented to the user.

 * finished the site configuration step but before it has moved on to the
 * final import of languages and the end of the installation. You can have any
 * number of custom tasks to perform during this phase.
 *
 * Each task you define here corresponds to a callback function which you must
 * separately define and which is called when your task is run. This function
 * will receive the global installation state variable, $install_state, as
 * input, and has the opportunity to access or modify any of its settings. See
 * the install_state_defaults() function in the installer for the list of
 * $install_state settings used by Drupal core.
 *
 * At the end of your task function, you can indicate that you want the
 * installer to pause and display a page to the user by returning any themed
 * output that should be displayed on that page (but see below for tasks that
 * use the form API or batch API; the return values of these task functions are
 * handled differently). You should also use #title within the task
 * callback function to set a custom page title. For some tasks, however, you
 * may want to simply do some processing and pass control to the next task
 * without ending the page request; to indicate this, simply do not send back
 * a return value from your task function at all. This can be used, for
 * example, by installation profiles that need to configure certain site
 * settings in the database without obtaining any input from the user.
 *
 * The task function is treated specially if it defines a form or requires
 * batch processing; in that case, you should return either the form API
 * definition or batch API array, as appropriate. See below for more
 * information on the 'type' key that you must define in the task definition
 * to inform the installer that your task falls into one of those two
 * categories. It is important to use these APIs directly, since the installer
 * may be run non-interactively (for example, via a command line script), all
 * in one page request; in that case, the installer will automatically take
 * care of submitting forms and processing batches correctly for both types of
 * installations. You can inspect the $install_state['interactive'] boolean to
 * see whether or not the current installation is interactive, if you need
 * access to this information.
 *
 * Remember that a user installing Drupal interactively will be able to reload
 * an installation page multiple times, so you should use \Drupal::state() to
 * store any data that you may need later in the installation process. Any
 * temporary state must be removed using \Drupal::state()->delete() before
 * your last task has completed and control is handed back to the installer.
 *
 * @param array $install_state
 *   An array of information about the current installation state.
 *
 * @return array
 *   A keyed array of tasks the profile will perform during the final stage of
 *   the installation. Each key represents the name of a function (usually a
 *   function defined by this profile, although that is not strictly required)
 *   that is called when that task is run. The values are associative arrays
 *   containing the following key-value pairs (all of which are optional):
 *   - display_name: The human-readable name of the task. This will be
 *     displayed to the user while the installer is running, along with a list
 *     of other tasks that are being run. Leave this unset to prevent the task
 *     from appearing in the list.
 *   - display: This is a boolean which can be used to provide finer-grained
 *     control over whether or not the task will display. This is mostly useful
 *     for tasks that are intended to display only under certain conditions;
 *     for these tasks, you can set 'display_name' to the name that you want to
 *     display, but then use this boolean to hide the task only when certain
 *     conditions apply.
 *   - type: A string representing the type of task. This parameter has three
 *     possible values:
 *     - normal: (default) This indicates that the task will be treated as a
 *       regular callback function, which does its processing and optionally
 *       returns HTML output.
 *     - batch: This indicates that the task function will return a batch API
 *       definition suitable for batch_set(). The installer will then take care
 *       of automatically running the task via batch processing.
 *     - form: This indicates that the task function will return a standard
 *       form API definition (and separately define validation and submit
 *       handlers, as appropriate). The installer will then take care of
 *       automatically directing the user through the form submission process.
 *   - run: A constant representing the manner in which the task will be run.
 *     This parameter has three possible values:
 *     - INSTALL_TASK_RUN_IF_NOT_COMPLETED: (default) This indicates that the
 *       task will run once during the installation of the profile.
 *     - INSTALL_TASK_SKIP: This indicates that the task will not run during
 *       the current installation page request. It can be used to skip running
 *       an installation task when certain conditions are met, even though the
 *       task may still show on the list of installation tasks presented to the
 *       user.
 *     - INSTALL_TASK_RUN_IF_REACHED: This indicates that the task will run on
 *       each installation page request that reaches it. This is rarely
 *       necessary for an installation profile to use; it is primarily used by
 *       the Drupal installer for bootstrap-related tasks.
 *   - function: Normally this does not need to be set, but it can be used to
 *     force the installer to call a different function when the task is run
 *     (rather than the function whose name is given by the array key). This
 *     could be used, for example, to allow the same function to be called by
 *     two different tasks.

 *   of that type. The keys in each subarray are:
 *   - 'title': Required. The human-readable name of the connection type.
 *   - 'class': Required. The name of the FileTransfer class. The constructor
 *     will always be passed the full path to the root of the site that should
 *     be used to restrict where file transfer operations can occur (the $jail)
 *     and an array of settings values returned by the settings form.
 *   - 'file': Required. The include file containing the FileTransfer class.
 *     This should be a separate .inc file, not just the .module file, so that
 *     the minimum possible code is loaded when authorize.php is running.
 *   - 'file path': Optional. The directory (relative to the Drupal root)
 *     where the include file lives. If not defined, defaults to the base
 *     directory of the module implementing the hook.
 *   - 'weight': Optional. Integer weight used for sorting connection types on

 *   set. The following keys can be altered:
 *   - text: The link text for the anchor tag as a translated string.
 *   - url_is_active: Whether or not the link points to the currently active
 *     URL.
 *   - url: The \Drupal\Core\Url object.
 *   - options: An associative array of additional options that will be passed
 *     to either \Drupal\Core\Routing\UrlGenerator::generateFromPath() or
 *     \Drupal\Core\Routing\UrlGenerator::generateFromRoute() to generate the
 *     href attribute for this link, and also used when generating the link.
 *     Defaults to an empty array. It may contain the following elements:
 *     - 'query': An array of query key/value-pairs (without any URL-encoding) to
 *       append to the URL.
 *     - absolute: Whether to force the output to be an absolute link (beginning
 *       with http:). Useful for links that will be displayed outside the site,
 *       such as in an RSS feed. Defaults to FALSE.
 *     - language: An optional language object. May affect the rendering of
 *       the anchor tag, such as by adding a language prefix to the path.
 *     - attributes: An associative array of HTML attributes to apply to the
 *       anchor tag. If element 'class' is included, it must be an array; 'title'
 *       must be a string; other elements are more flexible, as they just need
 *       to work as an argument for the constructor of the class
 *       Drupal\Core\Template\Attribute($options['attributes']).
 *     - html: Whether or not HTML should be allowed as the link text. If FALSE,
 *       the text will be run through
 *       \Drupal\Component\Utility\String::checkPlain() before being output.
